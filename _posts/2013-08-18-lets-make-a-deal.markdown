Recently I've been studying a lot of statistics, particularly Bayesian inference, which tells you how to update your beliefs when you get new information. One of the fun brain teasers you often read about is called the [Monty Hall problem.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) I'll let you read the wikipedia article.

Anyway, it is not obvious that the best strategy is to switch. You can prove it mathematically, but sometimes that doesn't always help people get it.

Fortunately, I have children.

One lazy day I decided we'd play this game, only with cups and a penny instead of doors and a fabulous prize. I also needed a screen (so the kids couldn't see where I hid the coin) and a six-sided die, to randomly choose a cup to hide the coin under. As a recovering D&D player, both of these were readily available.

First, I just let the kids guess which cup the coin was under. We did it 12 times, and they guessed right exactly 4 times: 33%, just like you'd expect! Then I told them about the Monty Hall problem, and that I wanted them to switch every time.

Here's what I realized: if you automatically switch, then the only time you lose is _when you initially guess right_. In other words, you only lose 33% of the time.

So if you've ever scratched your head over the solution to this problem, try it yourself! It only takes a few minutes, and if you have kids, they'll get a kick out of it too.

And let me know if you know what to feed a goat.
