I'm still reading _The Toyota Way_, and I'm quite enjoying it. One pattern I've noticed is that the author has several anecdotes about organizations that tried to adopt this or that feature of the Toyota system, only to fail and conclude "this stuff doesn't work." Except of course they really didn't get the core concept, so of course they failed.

This is similar to stories you hear about organizations trying to adopt Agile software methodologies: they try, say, pair programming, and it doesn't succeed so they conclude the whole thing is bunk. And while it's true that sometimes these things actually DON'T work in some organizations, I think what we're seeing is a sort of "[cargo cult](http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html)" phenomenon.

The best example of this in the Toyota book is a company that was going to adopt Toyota's practice of shutting down the line whenever somebody detects a problem. Toyota has a button and signal board system called _andon_ for this, and so the company bought a high-tech expensive button and signal board system. When the Japanese consultant guy saw this, he went to the hardware store and bought 3 cloth signal flags: red, yellow, green. "THIS is _andon_" he says.

I like that message. Half of this stuff is 90% mental.
