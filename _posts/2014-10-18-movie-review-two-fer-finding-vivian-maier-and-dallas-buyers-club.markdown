I recently watched two movies: [Finding Vivian Maier](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2714900/) and [Dallas Buyers Club](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0790636/). Here are some thoughts.

The latter is, of course, a big film starring Matthew McConaughey. He plays an oil-field worker named Ron Woodruff who contracts AIDS in the early 1980s. At the time, AZT was the treatment of choice, but Woodruff soon discovers that he gets better results using a different set of medications. Unfortunately, they're not approved by the FDA, so he has to smuggle them in from Mexico. He sees a business opportunity, but since he can't actually sell the drugs legally, he sells memberships in a club; club members get the drugs for free.

The other film is a documentary about an obscure---and rather odd---nanny who took thousands of street photographs. A young film-maker named John Maloof discovered a cache of her negatives at an auction, and realized he had discovered an artist. The film documents his search for this woman's story. There are few common themes in the movies that I'd like to discuss


### Don't Listen to the Experts


Ok, probably most of the time, the experts do know what they're talking about. Maybe a better way to put it is: believe your lying eyes. The experts told Woodruff that AZT was the way to go; his own experience was that it made him sicker, and he found a better treatment. In the case of Vivian Maier, Maloof got not interest from the "art establishment." Yet her work was immediately striking to everyone who saw it; the shows that he put on were packed.


### Become Obsessed


([This idea I got from Danger and Play](http://www.dangerandplay.com/2014/03/27/become-obsessed-point-madness/))

Maloof was so intrigued by this mystery woman---why had she taken all these pictures and simply hoarded them?---that he spent who knows how many hours sifting through her possessions and trying to find people who knew her. For example, he found several phone numbers written down among her papers. However, there were no area codes written down; the papers were from a time when the whole Chicago area had a single area code. So he called the numbers anyway...using every one of something like half-a-dozen area codes.

In Woodruff's case, the obsession is a little more practical: he literally was dealing with a life-or-death matter. He wound up taking on the FDA, the DEA, and the IRS. He didn't win, not completely, but they didn't break him either.


### Scale Yourself and Make the World Better


Woodruff's drugs didn't cure AIDS, of course. But by replicating his own treatment, he gave comfort and prolonged life to countless people. By creating a documentary about Vivian Maier, John Maloof brought to light some great art, and along the way made some art of his own. It's kind of a tired cliche, "making the world a better place." These men did it the right way: they found a way to deliver value to lots of people.
