I just finished [The Paleo Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/The-Paleo-Manifesto-Ancient-Lifelong/dp/0307889173) by John Durant. You might have seen him a while back on the Colbert Report. You may have also heard of the "paleo diet," or even possibly the "caveman" diet. Durant's book isn't really a diet book. Instead, it is more about re-thinking old traditions in terms of how they can help us thrive.

The book starts out by dividing human history into 5 ages: Animal, Paleolithic, Agricultural, Industrial, and Information.These are of course not original ideas: literally 5 minutes after I finished this book, I picked up my next read, _The Sovereign Individual_, which was published in 1997. The _second page _lists out those exact same ages (leaving out the Animal age). What Durant contributes, I think, especially for the "paleo" community, is that we can learn a lot of healthy practices from these other ages.

One thesis is that many cultural and religious traditions from the _Agricultural_ age are actually heuristics to promote health. For example, he shows how many Mosaic rules about cleanliness are good defenses against microbes: washing hands, avoiding contact with corpses, and so on.

The _Industrial_ age, on the other hand, is more of a study in what NOT to do. Here humans pushed the limits of their ability to survive in new habitats...even new worlds. We learned how to feed BILLIONS more people than ever before, escaping the _Malthusian_ trap...only to find ourselves _malnourished, _but in a way never before seen: the poorest people in our country are more likely to be obese!

In the _Information_ age, now, we are learning to be "biohackers," and to tweak our lives to bring back some of the ancient knowledge, coupled with modern science. And of course, part of this is the paleo diet. I sort of skimmed over this part, as it's pretty familiar territory, since I've been eating a sort-of paleo diet for about 5 years now. Here's my story.

Ever since I was a teenager, I had always been skinny; scrawny even. Then when I got to be around 30 years old, I started gaining weight---well, I started getting fat. I was drinking 4 to 6 Mountain Dews per day, I was eating half a pan of brownies almost every night, plus eating lots of pizza and Bojangles biscuits. Carb city! I was jogging quite a bit, too, going on 5k runs a couple of times a week. Cardio city!

I don't remember when exactly I started learning about the paleo/primal diet, but it must have been sometime in 2008 or so. I was reading several blogs, including [Mark's Daily Apple](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/#axzz2kHWKXZW1) and [Free the Animal](http://freetheanimal.com/). So I finally decided to try it out. I cut out pretty much ALL carbs that I could, started doing intermittent fasting (IF), sometimes up to 24 hours without eating. I stopped jogging and started doing "paleo" types of exercise, like Tabata sprints, pushups, pullups, etc.

And here's what happened:

That's me, in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Not bad, if I do say so myself! And keep in mind, that 2010 guy is 39 years old!

I never went "full paleo," eating only organic grass fed beef etc., and nowadays I pretty much will eat anything I want to, although I still try to avoid cereal grains. I eat two meals a day (so I have a daily 16-hour fast): lunch (typically bacon and eggs, plus a sweet potato or rice on lift days) and dinner (6-8 ounces of meat, plus a vegetable). I finish the day with a whey powder smoothie, and maybe some dark chocolate, nuts, a glass of milk. I don't usually count calories. I lift weights 3 times a week, for 30 minutes. And I walk the dog for 15 minutes each day. And that's it.  Does it work? Well, this is me a few months ago:

Back to the book: the book is a good quick read, and you'll likely enjoy it. The diet and exercise advice is, IMHO, sound. If you're already on the paleo bandwagon, you'll still get something from this book. And if you're not: what are you waiting for?
