I was lucky enough to attend [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) last week. I'm still putting together some thoughts on that, but here are a few quick takeaways:

First, Amazon continues to maintain a high bar with AWS. They're constantly innovating, shipping new products and features, and keeping the price low. Much respect.

Second, while the breakout sessions are not BAD, they are sometimes a summary of things you already know. And since the slides and videos are (eventually) available to all, the real value of attending is the opportunity to network and talk to people in person. This is something I need to get better at.
