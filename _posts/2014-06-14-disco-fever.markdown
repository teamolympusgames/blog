I learned to play the bass at age 17. My best friend could sing and play guitar, so of course he needed a bassist. We listened to a lot of heavy metal and hard rock. My idols were Steve Harris of Iron Maiden and Geddy Lee of Rush. Of course we though "hair metal" like Poison was for poseurs, and Disco was strictly out of the question.

Not long after started playing, I met a guy from the Caribbean (St. Vincent, I think); just think of him as Jamaican. He found out I played bass, and he said, "You must love Disco!"

Aghast, I denied it. He said, "Why not, mon? Disco has lots of great bass lines!" I shrugged this off at the time, but it stuck with me.

Nowadays, although I still love Iron Maiden and Rush, I'd rather _perform_ music that people want to dance to. And of course, that's what Disco is all about. So for your weekend pleasure:
