The Atlantic has an article on how [caffeine boosts athletic performance](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/how-athletes-strategically-use-caffeine/283758/). The "right dose" is "three to six milligrams per kilogram of body mass." I weigh about 85 kg, so that's 255 to 500 mg of caffeine.

Turns out that I _have_ noticed that drinking a 5-hour ENERGY® before lifting makes me feel stronger. And those have 200mg of caffeine. I also usually drink at least one Coke Zero, too, so that's right around 250 mg.
