You've heard of Michael Crichton. He was a pretty interesting fellow: very tall (6' 9"), medical doctor, best-selling author. Many of his novels were turned into movies. Indeed, [Wikipedia claims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton): " In 1994 Crichton became the only creative artist ever to have works simultaneously charting at No. 1 in television, film, and book sales (with _[ER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_series))_, _[Jurassic Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film))_, and _[Disclosure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclosure_(novel))_, respectively)."

Not too shabby.

I've read most of the novels he published under his own name (several of his early ones were pseudonymous). In general, I find them entertaining, but frequently seems to have a common theme or formula. Compare _Jurassic Park_ and _Westworld__._ It's pretty much the same story: out-of control theme-park creatures slaughtering people.

I just finished _Pirate Latitudes_, which was published posthumously. I really enjoyed it! Moves quickly, never really boring, and quite plausible.

We miss you, Michael Crichton.
