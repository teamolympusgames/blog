Digging through a bunch of junk I found some old lifting journals. I thought I'd post some notes here about my workouts for the last 3 years or so.

In January 2010, I bought a second-hand set of barbells. This is the lame 15-lb bar kind, with little 10-lb plates. I was lifting about twice a week, doing squats + overhead press one day, bench + deadlift another. Certainly nothing too heavy, as I didn't have a proper squat rack. I mixed in some pullups, pushups, dips, random dumbell lifts, and Tabata sprints. If you recall from a few posts ago, this was how I looked in the summer:

In July of 2010, I started doing P90X. I didn't do a whole 90 days; probably more like 60.

In September 2010 I started doing a [Body by Science](http://www.amazon.com/Body-Science-Research-Strength-Training/dp/0071597174) workout. I started going to the gym for just 20 minutes once a week. The workout used machines instead of free weights, and was basically: row, chest press, hamstring curl, lat pulldown, overhead press, and leg press. The idea was to do one set of extremely slow reps on each machine, spending a total of 60 to 90 seconds on each set. You put enough weight on so that you reach failure at the end of the set. You would probably call this a type of "high intensity interval training," or HIIT.

I will say this: it works great for keeping you in pretty good shape with minimal time investment. I did play around with the basic workout. Around May 2011 I started doing a twice-a-week split, with chest press, pulldown, and deadlifts one day, and overhead press, row, leg press, etc. the other day. I weighed somewhere around 175 lbs, which is about as light as I've been since high school.

In December 2011, I decided to try out [Leangains](http://www.leangains.com/). I stopped eating "breakfast"---or more accurately, I started breaking my fast around lunch time, and stopped eating after around 7pm. I switched my workout to a 3-day split "reverse pyramid training" routine:



	
  * Deadlift, pulldown, and row

	
  * Bench press, dips, and triceps extension

	
  * Squats, hamstring curls, and abs


I actually stopped doing deadlifts for several months, as I had intermittent lower-back pain. I started doing PT for that, and switched to the "hex bar" for deadlifts, and so far so good!

In July 2012 I decided I wanted to get BIG. So I switched to a [5-3-1 "big but boring"](http://www.strstd.com/) routine, which is a 3 or 4-day split of the "big 4" lifts (deadlift, overhead press, bench press, squat), along with some "accessory" lifts. This is still pretty much my routine now:



	
  * Deadlift + overhead press, lat pulldown and crunches

	
  * Bench press, dumbell row and flies

	
  * Squats, hamstring curls an calf raises


I wanted to get BIG so that I could be Riddick for Halloween, in October 2012. I got up to about 190 lbs, but I still wasn't completely satisfied.

Since then I've been pretty consistently doing the same routine. As I mentioned last post, I'm working on specific 1-rep-max weight goals. After that, who knows?
