On Jan 1, I set some [lifting goals]({% post_url 2014-01-01-do-you-even-lift-bro %}):



	
  * Overhead Press- 135 lbs

	
  * Bench Press - 225 lbs

	
  * Squat - 315 lbs

	
  * Deadlift - 405 lbs


Here's my latest PRs on these:

	
  * Overhead Press- 125 lbs

	
  * Bench Press - 215 lbs

	
  * Squat - 315 lbs

	
  * Deadlift - 385 lbs


Most of these were set in the last couple of weeks. My deadlift, however, peaked at the end of February, and I haven't been able to pull that much since. Here's a pic:

Of course, this was right after my chest-day workout, and I'm obviously flexing/posing. I look old!

In other news, I bought a juicer today, and I'm going to try that out for a bit.
