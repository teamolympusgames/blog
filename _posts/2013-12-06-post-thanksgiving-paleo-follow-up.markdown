I don't want this blog to be a paleo-focused one, but I thought I'd share some paleo-related thoughts while the topic is still fresh.

Last week was Thanksgiving, and Christmas is right around the corner, followed by New Year's resolutions. Terrible time to try to eat paleo, what with all the desserts (pie! cookies! cake!) loaded with gluten and fructose, not to mention bread-based dressing (that's "stuffing" to you Yankees). Fortunately, as I mentioned, I'm not hard-core, so I'll eat some mashed potatoes and fudge; still try to stay away from grains if I can.

Also, I try to keep the paleo preaching to a minimum. If people ask, I'll tell them, but I try not to be one of those people who tries to talk others into it. Still, sometimes the temptation is strong...

Over Thanksgiving week I visited with a friend, who's a bit older than me. This friend has several chronic problems: many pounds overweight, reflux, migraines. He's had these for years. It wouldn't surprise me if he's on statins. Also, his father developed type II diabetes and Alzheimer's ([which is strongly linked to diabetes](http://www.iol.co.za/scitech/science/news/alzheimer-s-diabetes-same-disease-1.1615191)) before he died.

So, what does my friend eat? Take-out, almost exclusively, his favorites being pizza, pasta, sandwiches....

Stop the insanity indeed. If I've ever seen anybody who needs to try to dump grains, it's my friend. But he won't, not if I know him.
