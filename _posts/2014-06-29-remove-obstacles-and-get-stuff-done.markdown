When I was a young lad fresh out of University, I decided to get a Master's degree. I enrolled in a tiny  school called the [University of Tennessee Space Institute](http://www.utsi.edu/). I learned a lot academically, but I also picked up a bad habit: windsurfing.

It was just insanely easy to go out. First, I was living in a dorm that was right on the lake. Second, UTSI had a boat club with a dock and boathouse just a few yards from the dorm. Inside were several boards and sails _already rigged up_. I could literally be sailing within five minutes of making up my mind to go. Couple that with the fact that it was grad school and I was only taking maybe three or four classes a semester, and that all the classrooms were about 100 yards from the lake....I was sailing pretty much any time the wind blew. I didn't care if the conditions were ideal, or that the gear was crap. I was sailing and having fun!

Fast forward to today. I have my own windsurfing gear, but it's in the crawl-space. The board probably won't even fit in my car; I'd have to borrow the wife's SUV and put it on the roof. It probably takes 5 or 10 minutes just to pack everything up. It's a 15-minute drive to a launch point on the lake. Then I have to rig the sail and walk my gear down to the water: another 10 minutes or so. Best case scenario, it's 30 minutes before I'm on the water. And that's assuming I'm home; if I'm at work and I decide the wind is crankin', I'm looking at probably an hour before I can get on the water, assuming I can even leave work.

Guess how many times I've been windsurfing in the last 5 years? Too many planets have to align before I feel like going to the trouble. _There are too many obstacles_.

I'm in a band, and I play bass and keys. I mostly play bass, but sometimes I play bass AND keys on the same song. Until this year, it was just bass, and so for practicing I had a [nifty device](http://tascam.com/product/mp-bt1/) that you can plug the bass into and play along to mp3s, listening via headphones. Of course, I can plug the keyboard into it, instead of the bass, so I can practice either instrument. But for the songs where I needed to transition, it was awkward. It was also kind of a chore to load songs onto the device, and it needs to be charged occasionally. It got to where I dreaded practicing, even though I really enjoy playing. Obstacles!

The nice thing is that sometimes obstacles can be removed by spending a little cash. I bought a little 4-channel mixer that has a headphone output. Now I've got bass and keys going into my headphones, and I can also send a signal into the "aux in" from either a computer or my mp3 device, so I can play along to a song.

Ah, but now I'm dragging around a bunch of cables. No fun! Turns out I had a spare wireless pack for my bass, and then I dropped a bit of cash on some wireless headphones. Now, I've basically replicated my live situation in the practice room, and no obstacles: I plug in the bass, flip a switch, and I'm jammin' and having fun!
