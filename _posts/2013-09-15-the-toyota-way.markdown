I recently read a [NYT article ](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/nyregion/in-lieu-of-money-toyota-donates-efficiency-to-new-york-charity.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)about how, as a charitable act, Toyota had some engineers helped a soup kitchen improve its process. I got a big kick out of that.

In fact, I like what I know about a lot of concepts from Toyota. Â For example, some of our dev teams at work use a "kanban" process to manage their projects, and I thought that also was a great idea.

So now I'm reading a book called _The Toyota Way_. I just started, and it sort of starts out with a bit of hagiography about the founders of Toyota, so far it's pretty good. It's probably going to be one of those "12 tips for managers" things, but we'll see.
