Pop quiz: what year did the Roman Empire fall? That's easy: AD 476, when Odoacer deposed Emperor Romulus Augustulus.

Of course, nobody asks such a question without a hidden agenda, so you might reply: "WHICH Roman Empire?" Because at the time of Odoacer, there were TWO: the Western Roman Empire, which Romulus Augustulus was ruling, and the Eastern Roman Empire, which we often call theÂ _Byzantine_ Empire. That empire lasted til 1453, when Constantinople finally fell to the Turks.

We are, of course, part of the cultural continuity of the Western empire, so naturally we study it more. Nothing wrong with that. But the Byzantine Empire is awfully interesting. I'm currently reading [Sailing From Byzantium](http://www.amazon.com/Sailing-Byzantium-Empire-Shaped-World/dp/055338273X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1377537102&sr=8-1&keywords=sailing+from+byzantium), which is about Byzantium's influence on its surrounding cultures: the West, the Slavs, and Islam.

I've only just begun reading it, but so far it seems pretty interesting. And it's short!
