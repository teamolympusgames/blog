Every now and then I think of all the stuff I want to do, change, improve. I'v got a big list! It gets overwhelming, and so I wind up in what in the software world is called "analysis paralysis." It's like the [donkey stuck between two piles of hay.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan's_ass)

So I'm just going to pick one, maybe two, new things to try, and let those burn in. First up, for February:



	
  * ZMA

	
  * Kale


[ZMA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZMA_(supplement)) is a supplement, which is supposed to aid recovery from workouts and also improve your sleep. I've taken it two nights, so far. Can't really tell any difference, but I have been sleeping pretty well, so maybe it's working.

As for the kale, I'm dropping a few leaves into the blender with my protein powder. It hasn't affected the taste too much. Again, can't really tell any difference, but it's only been a couple of days.

Next up, I think I might try juicing. I'm watching [Fat, Sick, & Nearly Dead](http://www.fatsickandnearlydead.com/)Â right now.
