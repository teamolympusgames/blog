Several years back I started taking Vitamin D supplements, in addition to switching to a paleo-ish diet. I do think I feel better and am healthier, but how do I know it's the Vitamin D that did it?

One important thing I learned about Vitamin D is that you need to take it FIRST THING in the morning. Otherwise, you won't sleep as well. I learned this from [Seth Roberts's blog](http://blog.sethroberts.net/category/sleep/vitamin-d3-and-sleep/).

Roberts is very much a proponent of "[personal science](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/2xc2h866)" and "quantified self." [He measures several things every day](http://blog.sethroberts.net/2011/08/18/my-self-tracking-wish-list/), including how much and how well he slept. The sleep quality definitely has a subjective component:


<blockquote>At 8 am and 9 am, I rate my energy on a 0-100 scale where 50 = neither sluggish nor energetic/energized, 60 = slightly energetic/energized, 70 = somewhat energetic/energized, and 75 = energetic/energized.</blockquote>


In the spirit of my previous post about [trying one new thing]({% post_url 2014-02-03-try-just-one-new-thing %}), I am going to start measuring Â my sleep. I downloaded [Sleep Cycle](http://www.sleepcycle.com/) for my phone, and I'll try that out for a week or so. Normally I sleep pretty well and regularly: I take Vitamin D in the morning, and melatonin and ZMA right before bed. However, I am in a band and so two or three nights a month I'll be up til 3am. That's rough!

Once I get a baseline on my sleep, I'll see if [taking honey before bedtime ](http://blog.sethroberts.net/2013/11/05/honey-at-bedtime-improves-sleep/)improves my sleep. That's going to be my new thing for March.
