I think I've spent more time than not in "three piece" bands: simply drums, bass, and guitar (and vocals, of course). While this is a perfectly serviceable rock configuration that has worked well for lots of great bands (Zep, ZZ Top, Motley Crue...), it always feels like you lose some punch during the guitar solo.

I've found the perfect solution: [the Fishman Fission Bass Powerchord FX Pedal](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005INZV3U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005INZV3U&linkCode=as2&tag=teaolygam-20&linkId=VAUOBVLFXJUW2PGE). This delightful little box takes your bass signal adds an octave above, plus:

* the fourth below (i.e, the fifth above your bass note)
* OR the fifth above the octave
* OR both of those
* OR the fifth above plus the octave above that!
* everything except your original bass runs through an adjustable overdrive

So in effect, it gives you a rhythm guitar that is directly mimicking your bass line, either just the root or as various "power chord" inversions.

I'm too lazy to draw a picture, so imagine this: you're the bass, and you're playing the open A string. This box will sound like a rhythm guitarist playing his open A string, plus any of:
* open E string
* 2nd fret on D string
* both the open E and the 2nd fret on D
* 2nd fret on D plus 2nd fret on G

As you can hear on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2XKZNMR2Pc), it sounds pretty passable. In fact, it's so cool my biggest concern has been: how do I resist the temptation of OVER using it?
