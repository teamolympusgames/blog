Paul Graham has a new essay: [Before the Startup](http://paulgraham.com/before.html). I like his stuff; his [essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) aren't too long, and they contain some great ideas.

This latest is his advice to a class of college students, about whether or not they should start a startup. I thought this bit, on how to come up with startup ideas, was interesting:


<blockquote>But although I can't explain in the general case what counts as an interesting problem, I can tell you about a large subset of them. If you think of technology as something that's spreading like a sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents an interesting problem. So one guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type that has good startup ideas is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology—to cause yourself, as Paul Buchheit put it, to "live in the future." When you reach that point, ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem obvious to you. You may not realize they're startup ideas, but you'll know they're something that ought to exist.</blockquote>


This is very much like Cal Newport's description in [So Good They Can't Ignore You]({% post_url 2014-09-14-book-review-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you %}), to explore the "adjacent possible" by working on the cutting edge of some technology.

I suppose this is an example of confirmation bias, but I've found that when I read a lot, I see certain ideas repeated in different places. Maybe I'll do a meta-post on that.
