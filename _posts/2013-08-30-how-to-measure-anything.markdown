I recently read a book called [How to Measure Anything](http://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/0470539399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1377821540&sr=8-1&keywords=how+to+measure+anything). I quite enjoyed it. The target audience are management types, and so it's not super-technical, but it wasn't too dumb to enjoy either.

I guess the main theme is that you can find ways to reduce uncertainty about things, to help you make better business decisions. Here are a few takeaway concepts:

1. A lot of times people object that you can't even measure something; for example, "IT security."  The author points out that if something has an effect on the world, then it must be observable, and therefore you can measure SOMETHING; or at least you can _reduce your uncertainty_ about it._
_

2. Often when you ask people to estimate a quantity---say, the wingspan of a 747---they respond, "I have no idea!" Well, you can at least come up with some bounds on what's not absurd. You know a 747's wingspan is more than, say, 1 foot. And you know it's less than a mile. If you think a little bit, you can push those bounds in a little more until you have an interval that you are 95% sure brackets the true value.

That last concept, the 95% interval thinking, I find particularly interesting, and I have a feeling it's one of those habits that can be very powerful. At least, I'm 95% sure.
