[So Good They Can't Ignore You, by Cal Newport](http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6/). I found a recommendation for this book on [Derek Sivers's blog](http://sivers.org/book/SoGood). The idea of this book is: "follow your passion" is bad advice, if your goal is to find work you love. The one sentence summary is: "working right trumps finding the right work."

The book is organized in sections, one for each of  four rules, and each rule is illustrated with stories of how some person found a great career (or didn't, as the case may be). And (I always love this) there's a one-page summary at the end of each section.

Rule #1 is, again, "Don't follow your passion." This is shortest section of the book, with three short chapters explaining why it's a bad idea. Ok, if we're not going to follow our passion, then how DO we find a great career?

Rule #2 is the title of the book: "Be so good they can't ignore you." Develop valuable and rare skills. Newport calls this "career capital," and says to adopt a "craftsman mindset." And he mentions deliberate practice and (a la Gladwell) the 10k hour rule.

Rule #3 is to invest your career capital in _"_gaining control over what you do and how you do it." But beware of the two control traps: 1) don't try to gain control "without enough capital to back it up," and 2) your employer will fight back, as more control is good for you but not for them. To help guide you between these traps, use the "law of financial viability," which Newport attributes to Sivers's maxim: "do what people are willing to pay for."

Rule #4 is: have a mission. Now, you may be thinking: how is that different from following your passion? The difference is, you don't _start_ with a mission. Instead, as you master your craft, you explore the "adjacent possible." That is: you learn what's right out there on the cutting edge. Then you try small projects on that cutting edge: "little bets." And you market yourself: Newport calls this the "law of remarkability." Literally: you must do things that people remark upon.

Newport provides a Conclusion section where he describes how he applied these rules to his own job search after he earned a PhD in Computer Science. I found this section to be quite insightful.

For one, I notice that Newport's entrepreneurial and literary career began early. He co-founded a web-site design company in high school, and he published a student advice guide in college. He learned early on the mindset of abundance: when trying to decide between a job and grad school, he knew "either path would yield numerous opportunities that could be leveraged into a remarkable life."

He also describes several activities he uses to hone his craft. I found these very interesting. First, he describes how he took a paper that was both well-cited in his field, but also widely known to be "obtuse  and hard to follow." He set himself to understanding the proofs in the paper. This was daunting, hard work, but it led to several benefits. He could now understand related work that he previously couldn't. He could do original work in the area and publish more papers. He even found mistakes in the original paper!

The key here is _mental exercise_, which came up in [Altucher's book]({% post_url 2014-08-09-book-review-two-fer-choose-yourself-and-secrets-of-the-millionaire-mind %}). Just as with physical exercise, where you put a strain on your muscles, you must put a strain on your brain. You must, in fact, seek out discomfort; it's a sign of progress. You must change your mindset from _productivity-centric_ to _craft__-centric._

He also describes three routines he incorporates in his daily activites: Research Bible (summarizing papers, one a week), Hour Tally (total hours per month spent in deliberate practice), and Theory Notebook (an expensive lab notebook for brainstorming new theory results).

He also says something interesting about mission: because discovering a mission requires career capital (which takes time to accumulate) and then exploring the "adjacent possible" by brainstorming new ideas, this is actually a _lifestyle_, not an algorithm. In a way, you're always refining the mission. So he has a "mission pyramid."

The top level is a short guideline; in Newport's case: "apply distributed algorithm theory." This is a lot like a corporate mission statement; short, pithy, inspiring. The bottom level is research. Every week he learns something new: reads a paper, goes to a talk, etc. He also goes on a walk every day to do free-form thinking about new ideas.

The middle layer is where most of the work gets done. This is a set of two or three "little bets": exploratory projects, about one month long, where you must create new value and produce a concrete result for concrete feedback. Sounds an awful lot like a [sprint in Scrum](http://scrummethodology.com/scrum-sprint/)!

All in all, a good book. I especially liked Newport's description of his own practices, as his profession is fairly closely related to my own: he's a CS prof, I'm a software dev. It's about 250 pages long, so you can polish it off in a weekend.
