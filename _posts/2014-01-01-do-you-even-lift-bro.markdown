It's the New Year, so it's time to make resolutions! My main focus lately has been weightlifting. I have decided to set some 1-rep max goals for my 4 main lifts:



	
  * Overhead Press- 135 lbs

	
  * Bench Press - 225 lbs

	
  * Squat - 315 lbs

	
  * Deadlift - 405 lbs


Keen observers will notice those numbers are the standard 45 lbs of a bar, plus 1, 2, 3, and 4 45-lb plates per side. I'd like to hit these numbers in time for my 43rd birthday in May. Here's how things stood two weeks ago (the week before Christmas):



	
  * Overhead Press - 115 lbs

	
  * Bench Press - 195 lbs

	
  * Squat - 295 lbs

	
  * Deadlift - 365 lbs


So my required percent changes are 17%, 15%, 7%, and 11%. Probably not impossible. However, I've been looking over my lifting journal for the past couple of years, and here's how things stood the week before Christmas 2012:

	
  * Overhead Press - 110 lbs

	
  * Bench Press - 180 lbs

	
  * Squat - 245 lbs

	
  * Deadlift - 255 lbs


Percent changes year-over-year: 5%, 8%, 20%, and 43% (!). Good progress on legs, but not so much on arms.  Not sure what to do here. I'm open to suggestions!
