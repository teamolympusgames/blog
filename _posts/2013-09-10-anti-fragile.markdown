[Nassim N. Taleb's](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/) (of "Black Swan" fame) latest is calledÂ _Antifragile,_ and our library had it on the shelf, so I read it.

Well, skimmed it. I really wanted this book to knock my socks off, because Taleb is sort of a demi-god in the web circles that I frequent. And it was not a bad book. It seemed kind of anecdote-y, and a bit sprawling, but that's ok. You should read and form your own opinion!

On a side note, does your brain ever link two people together, even though you have no explicit reason to link them? For example, my brain wants to link Dan Baird (the Georgia Satellites guy) with John Fogerty (the CCR guy). I don't know why; I have no idea if Fogerty influenced Baird or not. My brain just lumps them together using its own mysterious measure of similarity.

Likewise, my brain seems to have lumped Taleb with Umberto Eco. Again, I have no idea why; I don't remember reading anywhere that the two men have even HEARD of each other. Maybe it's the beards.
