I occasionally browse Hacker News. Today I found there this blog post on [exact numeric nth derivates](http://jliszka.github.io/2013/10/24/exact-numeric-nth-derivatives.html). All I can say is: clever!

"The idea is that you introduce an algebraic symbol ϵ such that ϵ≠0 but ϵ [squared]=0."

That's right. You use the square root of zero. Well, not exactly. It turns out that ϵ isn't a number. It's a matrix.

Matrices: is there anything they can't do?
