Somehow I wound up in the [158.](http://dewey.info/class/158.1/about.en)1 section of the library---self-improvement books, and I saw one titled [The Power of Full Engagement](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Full-Engagement-Managing-Performance/dp/0743226755/). What was especially interesting was the subtitle: "Managing Energy, Not TIme." That reminded me of [something I read a while back by Scott Adams]({% post_url 2013-10-08-success %}): "it’s not passion you want; it’s energy." All right, then!

Right off the bat, the book says there's four kinds of energy: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. [What a surprise]({% post_url 2014-08-09-book-review-two-fer-choose-yourself-and-secrets-of-the-millionaire-mind %})! Like physical energy, the others are expended by activities and must be replenished. The book recommends interval training as the best for physical energy, and presumably for the others as well: stress the system hard, then recover. Physically and spiritually, we are usually under-stressed, while mentally and emotionally we are over-stressed. For better results at your job, the book recommends working hard for 90 to 120 minutes, then rest and recover.

In case you're not sure what emotional, mental, and spiritual energy really mean, there's a handy chart:

Notice under "mental" are some familiar items: visualization, positive attitude.

One very interesting point is that the book recommends you begin with the spiritual aspect: figure out your purpose. Having a purpose, especially one beyond yourself, can be a source of energy.

I have a few quibbles with their nutrition advice: breakfast is the most important meal, don't eat a lot of fat. Whatever; the rest of the nutrition advice is OK: don't eat a lot of processed junk.

Like a lot of these books, there's anecdotes about corporate executives. I kind of get tired of reading those, so imagine my delight when I found out there's an appendix that summarizes everything with bullet points! I wish all self-improvement books did the same.
