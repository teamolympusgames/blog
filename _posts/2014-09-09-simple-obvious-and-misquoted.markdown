"For every problem, there is a solution which is simple, obvious, and wrong."

Maybe you've heard this phrase before. I like it a lot: it's short, it's witty, and it has a ring of truth to it (and it's the premise of every single episode of _Three's Company). _ Surely you nodded in agreement the first time you saw or heard it.

But who originated it? [Let me Google that for you...](https://www.google.com/search?q=simple+obvious+and+wrong)

A common answer is Mark Twain. It certainly sounds like something he'd say. It's funny yet slightly cynical. Yet, the Internet isn't unanimous in its attribution. The #2 result on Google attributes it to Einstein. Again, this is believable. After all, Einstein also said something about "make things as simple as possible, but no simpler" (at least...the Internet says he said it), plus many of other quips, like God not playing with dice.

But the top answer on Google is H. L. Mencken. Again, quite plausible, Mencken being a less-famous, more directly caustic version of Twain who stayed in the newspaper business. And now things get interesting, as the #1 answer on Google has the quote reading thus:

"For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong."

This might be an even better phrasing. The contrast between "complex" and "simple" is nice, especially if you're speaking. You pause after the simple, giving your audience hope.....then drop "and wrong" on them!

But if you poke around in a few results lower down, you get [this](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=512538):


<blockquote>"There is always an easy solution to every human problem--neat, plausible, and wrong."

It appeared in the essay "The Divine Afflatus," originally published in 1917, and reprinted in 1920 and 1949.</blockquote>


An actual citation! And the prose is a little more complicated, which actually makes it look more authentically Mencken. You have to pay attention when you read Mencken; people had longer attention spans back then. Now, I am not able to confirm this citation at the moment; I only have one Mencken book in my library and this essay isn't in it.

At any rate, the moral of this tale is: for every situation, there's an internet quote that is pithy, witty, and misattributed.
