[Choose Yourself by James Altucher](http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Yourself-James-Altucher-ebook/dp/B00CO8D3G4/) and [Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Eker](http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Millionaire-Mind-Harv-Eker-ebook/dp/B000FCJZ3G/)

Several years ago a relative gave me a copy of Eker's book, and I finally got around to reading it earlier this year. Then recently, a blog called [Danger and Play recommended](http://www.dangerandplay.com/2014/06/17/how-to-become-successful/) Altucher's book.

Both books are relatively short, and both are what I think of as "fluffy": filled with anecdotes and written in a middle-brow "straight-talk" style. Both would be considered "self-improvement" plans, intended to help regular people become successful entrepreneurs.

Both books have some similar advice. Most strikingly, both books frame human well-being along four axes: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. I suspect both authors are drawing from common sources here, but I don't know what those are.

Most of the content of the books can be boiled down to several helpful bullet points. At least, that's what I like to do with them. Again, there are several parallels: think positive thoughts, don't complain. Don't associate with negative people. Create value by enhancing the lives of _lots_ of people.

Of the two, Altucher's book is naturally fresher in my mind. One thing he recommends is a daily practice of thinking of 10 new ideas. He likens this to building an "idea muscle." I found this interesting, as a colleague of mine recently said something very similar. I'm going to try to make this part of my daily routine.
