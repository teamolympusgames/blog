I can't remember what year, but one recent Christmas my kids got a [snap-together circuit kit](http://kids.woot.com/offers/brainbox-500-electronic-learning-kit). I pulled it out last night to goof around with it; it's pretty neat!

One thing I really like about it is that the circuits, when assembledÂ _look like a schematic_. Contrast that with the [good-old-fashioned "spring"-type Radio Shack kits](http://makezine.com/2010/01/25/piecing-together-a-vintage-radio-sh/), which just looked like a rat's nest. Now, I'll concede the Radio Shack kits were more flexible---you could build some involved circuits. If you screwed up...good luck figuring that out! Kind of like the Basic programs I wrote back then, too..

Anyway, I found a neat little oscillator circuit, and I want to brush off my EE skills and see if I can remember my circuit analysis.
