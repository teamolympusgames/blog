When someone on the internet recommends a book, I usually drop it in an Amazon wishlist. For some reason, back in 2003 I added [The Lady Tasting Tea](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0716741067/). I finally saw it the other day in the local library, so I picked it up.

I enjoyed it. It tells the story of how modern statistics was invented; it pretty much happened in the 20th Century. The book spends a lot of time talking about the early giants of the field, and they were giants indeed. If there are any "main characters," these would be R. A. Fisher, Jerzy Neyman, as well as Karl Pearson and his son.

Then just a few days ago, I found this article about how the [p-value in statistical testing is misunderstood](http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700). The p-value is, of course, the way you tell if something is "statistically significant." The article credits Fisher with introducing the concept, and mentions Neyman and the younger Pearson.

What's interesting to me in this article is [this diagram](http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700#/cause) that gives a graphical interpretation of a meaning of the p-value. It's basically Bayesian inference: you have a prior belief about the probability of something being true, you do the experiment, and now you have a posterior belief about the probability of it being true. Note that unless your prior belief is quite strong, even a p-value of 1% won't get you anywhere close to being 99% sure.

Another interesting point is that even if the p-value tells you something is significant---for example, a different in divorce rates between two groups---that difference might not be very much. In this example, the two groups were couples who met online vs. ones who didn't. The online-meeters did have a lower divorce rate, and the p-value was less than 0.002. That's really small, so the probability that the measured divorces rates between the two groups is due to random chance is very small. Significance!

But here's the thing. The divorce rate for the non-online group was 7.67%. The rate for the online group? 5.96%. Sure, it's lower, but...well, that doesn't really seem that exciting now.

Back to the book: definitely recommend, especially if you have any interest in statistics or mathematics. And why wouldn't you?
