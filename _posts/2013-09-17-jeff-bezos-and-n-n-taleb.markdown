You might recall I read _Antifragile_ recently. One of the interesting things that Taleb pointed out is that the longer a technology HAS been around, the more likely it will STAY around. Example: the wheel. We've been using wheels for some time now, and will likely continue using them for...ever probably.

Today I saw this [list of 20 smart things Jeff Bezos said](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/09/09/the-25-smartest-things-jeff-bezos-has-ever-said.aspx). How about this one:


<blockquote> "I very frequently get the question: 'What's going to change in the next 10 years?' And that is a very interesting question; it's a very common one. I almost never get the question: 'What's not going to change in the next 10 years?' And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two -- because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time."</blockquote>


Just so.
