Derek Sivers, the founder of CD Baby, has a [fantastic blog](http://sivers.org/blog). I've been reading through the archives; there's lots of gold there. [Here's an example](http://sivers.org/cs):

_All bad service comes from a mindset of scarcity, feeling like they’ll go out of business if they don’t fiercely guard their bottom line....__If you really feel secure, abundant, that you have plenty to share, then this feeling of generosity will flow down into all of your interactions with customers. _

This point is made again and again in the "self improvement" books and blogs that I've been reading: have a mindset of abundance, not scarcity.
